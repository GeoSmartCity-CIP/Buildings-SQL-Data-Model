# Buildings-SQL-Data-Model
SQL implementation of the INSPIRE “Buildings” data themes, extended with extra properties related to energy

As a result of the activities carried out in the frame of Task 3.2 – Data harmonisation, this deliverable provides details about the GSC data models revision, the description of the Pilots’ harmonisation process and the list of harmonised datasets.
This repository contains the SQL implementation of the INSPIRE “Buildings” data themes (Oracle and PostGIS versions), extended with extra properties related to energy.
The data model relies on the INSPIRE "Buildings" Implementing Rules, as defined in the COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1253/2013, of 21 October 2013, amending Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services [1] and the corresponding Technical Guidelines (http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_Specifications/INSPIRE_DataSpecification_BU_v3.0.pdf)
